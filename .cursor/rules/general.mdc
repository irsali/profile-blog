# Svelte Profile Blog - General Rules

## Code Quality & Standards

### TypeScript
- Always use TypeScript for all `.ts` and `.svelte` files
- Define proper interfaces and types in `src/lib/types.ts`
- Use strict type checking and avoid `any` types
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Export types and interfaces that are used across multiple files
- Use type assertions (`as HTMLElement`) when accessing DOM properties
- Implement proper error handling with graceful fallbacks

### Svelte Components
- Use Svelte 5 syntax with `$props()` and `$state()`
- Write doc comments for each function and component (JSDoc format)
- Use proper prop typing with `export let` statements
- Implement reactive statements with `$:` when needed
- Use `onMount()` for side effects and DOM manipulation
- Prefer `{#if}`, `{#each}`, and `{#await}` blocks over imperative code
- Implement proper lifecycle management for animations and effects

### File Organization
- Keep components in `src/lib/components/` for reusable UI
- Place services in `src/lib/services/` with proper separation of concerns
- Store types in `src/lib/types.ts`
- Use descriptive file names that match their purpose
- Group related functionality in the same directory
- Organize data files in `src/lib/data/` for profile and content data

## Blog Post Management

### Markdown Posts
- Store all blog posts in `src/posts/blog/` with `.md` extension
- Use consistent frontmatter structure:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Post Title"
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  description: "Brief description"
  categories: ["category1", "category2"]
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
  icon: "icon-name"
  ---
  ```
- Use descriptive filenames with date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`
- Include proper markdown formatting with headers, lists, and code blocks
- Use relative paths for images in `static/static/blog/` directory

### Post Service
- Extend `PostService` in `src/lib/services/post.service.ts` for new functionality
- Add proper error handling for missing metadata
- Implement caching for performance when needed
- Use async/await patterns consistently
- Add JSDoc comments for all public methods

## Styling & Design

### CSS & Theming
- Use CSS custom properties for theming: `var(--color-primary)`, `var(--color-bg)`, etc.
- Maintain responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use semantic color names in CSS variables
- Implement dark/light theme support with CSS variables
- Use consistent spacing and typography scales

### Component Styling
- Use `class:` directive for conditional styling
- Implement proper hover and focus states
- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast ratios
- Use consistent spacing and typography scales
- Implement smooth transitions and animations
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts

### Animation System
- Use `animate.css` library for pre-built animations
- Implement viewport-triggered animations with Intersection Observer
- Use `data-animate` attributes for flexible animation system
- Apply staggered delays using CSS custom properties
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth DOM updates
- Implement proper animation cleanup and lifecycle management

## Performance & Best Practices

### Build Optimization
- Use `@sveltejs/adapter-static` for static site generation
- Optimize images and assets in `static/` directory
- Implement proper lazy loading for components
- Use `import.meta.glob()` for dynamic imports
- Optimize animation performance with GPU acceleration

### Code Organization
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states for async operations
- Implement proper cleanup for event listeners and animations
- Use modular function structure for maintainability

## Documentation

### Code Comments
- Write doc comments for each function and component (JSDoc format)
- Document complex business logic and animation implementations
- Explain non-obvious code decisions and performance optimizations
- Use JSDoc format for TypeScript functions with parameter descriptions
- Document animation triggers and interaction patterns

### README & Documentation
- Keep `README.md` updated with setup instructions
- Document any new features or configuration changes
- Include examples for common tasks and animation implementations
- Maintain changelog for significant updates
- Document animation system usage and customization options

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Run `npm run check` to verify TypeScript types
- Use `npm run lint` to check code quality
- Fix all linting errors before committing
- Validate animation performance and smoothness
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes

### Content Validation
- Validate frontmatter structure for all blog posts
- Ensure all required metadata fields are present
- Check for broken links and missing images
- Verify proper markdown syntax
- Test animation triggers and interaction patterns
- Validate theme switching functionality

## Deployment & Configuration

### Environment Setup
- Use `npm run dev` for local development
- Use `npm run build` for production builds
- Configure proper environment variables
- Set up proper Git hooks for pre-commit checks
- Test animation performance in production builds

### Static Assets
- Organize images in `static/static/blog/` by category
- Use descriptive image names
- Optimize images for web delivery
- Maintain proper directory structure for assets
- Optimize profile images and icons for fast loading
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP, AVIF) when possible

## Security & Best Practices

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs and frontmatter data
- Sanitize markdown content when needed
- Use proper TypeScript types to prevent runtime errors
- Implement proper error handling for edge cases

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use specific version numbers in package.json
- Audit dependencies regularly for security issues
- Prefer stable, well-maintained packages
- Include animation libraries (animate.css) in dependency management
- Monitor performance impact of third-party libraries

## Accessibility

### Web Standards
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy
- Use alt text for all images
- Ensure animations don't interfere with accessibility

### User Experience
- Provide clear navigation and breadcrumbs
- Implement proper loading states
- Use consistent design patterns
- Ensure responsive design works on all devices
- Implement smooth animations that enhance UX
- Provide fallbacks for users with reduced motion preferences
- Ensure custom cursor effects work with assistive technologies

## Advanced Features & Interactions

### Custom Cursor System
- Implement custom cursor with glow effects for desktop
- Use `cursor: none` for custom cursor elements
- Provide mobile fallback to default system cursor
- Implement hover scaling and color changes
- Ensure cursor follows mouse movement smoothly
- Add interactive states for different element types

### Typing Effects
- Implement character-by-character typing animations
- Use space reservation to prevent layout shifts
- Provide blinking cursor during typing
- Remove cursor after typing completion
- Support multiline text with proper height calculation
- Use visibility overlay technique for layout stability

### Ripple Effects
- Implement dynamic ripple creation on click
- Calculate ripple size based on element dimensions
- Position ripple at exact click coordinates
- Use CSS animations for smooth ripple expansion
- Implement auto-cleanup after animation completion
- Apply to all interactive elements (buttons, links, cards)

### Theme Management
- Implement dark/light theme switching
- Use CSS custom properties for theme variables
- Store theme preference in localStorage
