There are two ways found to work around Network

- The Microsoft .NET Framework provides a layered, extensible, and managed implementation of Internet services that can be quickly and easily integrated into your applications. Your network applications can build on pluggable protocols to automatically take advantage of new Internet protocols

- You can use a managed implementation of the Windows socket interface to work with the network on the socket level.
